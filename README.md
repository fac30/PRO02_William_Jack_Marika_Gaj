# PRO02_William_Jack_Marika_Gaj
This project aims to create a Discord chatbot that leverages the OpenAI API to generate intelligent responses to user messages in a Discord channel. The bot will be built using Node.js and the discord.js and openai libraries, following best practices for secure configuration, performance optimization, and robust error handling.



Project Setup
Libraries Required
discord.js
openai
dotenv
To install these libraries, run:

bash
Copy code
npm install discord.js openai dotenv
Secure Configuration
To ensure API keys are not hard-coded, create a .env file in the root of your project with the following format:

plaintext
Copy code
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Don't forget to create a .gitignore file and include .env in it to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.

Discord Preparations
Bot Initialisation: Use new Discord.Client() and client.login() to authenticate with Discord.
Message Handling: Set up client.on('messageCreate', callback) to listen for incoming messages.
Optimisation: Ensure event handlers are efficient to avoid resource hogging.
Core User Stories
Project Setup with Libraries: Set up a Node.js project with required libraries.
Secure Configuration: Load API keys from a .env file.
Bot Initialisation: Log into Discord and start listening for messages.
Message Handling: Respond to messages with a "hello" reply.
OpenAI Chat Integration: Use openai.chat.completions.create() to generate responses based on message content.
Response Management: Send responses back to Discord using async/await.
Command Processing: Identify commands directed at the bot using string matching.
Error Handling: Implement error handling for bot interactions.
Stretch User Stories
Messaging Users Directly: Use user.send() to send DMs.
Dialogue Boxes: Implement buttons and menus using MessageActionRow.
Creating Private Chats: Create channels with guild.channels.create().
Automated Moderation: Monitor messages for inappropriate content.
Multimedia Responses: Send images and audio clips using message.channel.send().
Testing Integration
Integrate testing to ensure functionality and reliability:

Verify Discord.js integration.
Test OpenAI API integration for chat completions.
Confirm secure loading of API keys from the .env file.
Ensure bot logs into Discord successfully.
Simulate message reception to verify bot responses.
Test command processing.
Implement error handling tests.
Mock message sending and multimedia responses.
Example Test Case
javascript
Copy code
const { Client } = require('discord.js');
const { expect } = require('chai');

describe('Discord Bot', () => {
  let client;

  before(() => {
    client = new Client();
  });

  it('should initialize Discord client', () => {
    expect(client).to.be.an('object');
  });

  // Additional tests...
});
Technologies Used
Node.js
Discord.js
